The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator is a Python program that calculates a person's BMI based on their weight and height. BMI is a measure of body fat and is widely used as a screening tool to identify potential health problems. This project allows users to input their weight and height, and calculates their BMI using the formula (weight in pounds * 703) / (height in inches * height in inches). 

After calculating the BMI, the program prints a message indicating the user's weight status based on established BMI ranges. The BMI ranges used in the program are based on established guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO), which are widely recognized and accepted. The program is user-friendly and generates clear and informative output that can help users assess their overall health status. It is a useful tool for anyone who wants to quickly and easily calculate their BMI and assess their overall health status.
